# SMN1/SMN2 TARGETED NANOPORE SEQUENCING ANALYSIS PIPELINE  

**CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse – Tunisia**  
_Comprehensive Molecular Diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Using Long-Read Sequencing_  

---

## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW  

This repository contains sequencing data and analysis pipelines for the molecular diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients from CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse (Tunisia).  

We employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) targeted sequencing of the SMN1/SMN2 locus, combined with advanced bioinformatics, to:  

- Detect pathogenic variants  
- Identify copy number variations (CNVs)  
- Characterize SMN1–SMN2 hybridization patterns  

---

## 🧬 KEY FINDINGS  

- **8 SMA patients** analyzed using targeted Nanopore sequencing  
- **Pathogenic deletions** identified in the SMN1 gene  
- Detection of the **SMN1/SMN2 discriminatory variant** (c.840C>T at chr5:70,951,946)  
- Use of a **masked reference approach** to improve SMN1-specific variant calling  
- Identification of **pathogenic variants not detected by conventional methods**

## ⚙️ WORKFLOW  

### 🔹 Raw Data Preparation  
- **Target region**: SMN1 gene (chr5:70,910,000–70,960,000)  
- **Platform**: ONT MinION MK1B  
- **Samples**: 8 patients (barcode08–barcode15)  
- **Coverage**: >100X per patient  

### 🔹 Analysis Pipeline  
1. Reference preparation with SMN2 masking (chr5:70,048,000–70,078,000)  
2. Read alignment using **minimap2**  
3. Variant calling with **Clair3**  
4. Structural variant detection  
5. SMN1/SMN2 discrimination analysis  
6. Pathogenic variant validation  

### 🔹 Masked Reference Strategy  
The **SMN2 region was replaced with N’s** to force read alignment to SMN1, improving variant calling specificity and reducing mapping ambiguity.

## 🔬 GOALS  

- Provide a **robust molecular diagnosis workflow** for SMA using long-read sequencing  
- Detect **SMN1-specific pathogenic variants** (including deletions in homopolymer regions)  
- Compare **Nanopore-based results with conventional diagnostic methods**  
- Build an **open bioinformatics resource** for SMA research and clinical genomics
